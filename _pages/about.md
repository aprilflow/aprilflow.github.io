Hello! You can call me _April_, though I will also respond to _pam_ or _pamyl_, My pronouns are **she/her**.

![Profile Picture](../assets/images/ProfPicSpring2019-sq.jpg)

I am a PhD candidate in [Alice Berger's Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/berger/en.html) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) and [University of Washington Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/). For my doctoral research, I study how cancer hijacks our cells' systems for its own benefit! In more technical terms, my work is on oncogene-driven transcriptional regulation in lung cancer.

Before graduate school, I got my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics and Statistics from the Johns Hopkins University where I also worked with the Karchin lab and got my first taste of computational cancer biology.

When I'm not doing research I'm thoroughly enjoying exploring the Pacific Northwest and my many hobbies which include playing music, knitting, and streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pamylz)!

## Random Fun Facts
- My birthday is on April 1st. No that's not an April Fools joke. Yes, that's why my name is April :)
- I have some unidentifiable mixed accent thatâ€™s weird
- I play the violin, am ok at guitar, and have a budding record collection
