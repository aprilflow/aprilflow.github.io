      excerpt: "You can call me _April_, though I also respond to _pamyl_. 我的名字是羅方淳.<br><br>I am a Computational Biologist at Adaptive Biotechnologies in Seattle where I work with Adaptive's academic and pharmaceutical partners to use our immunosequencing platforms to improve cancer care and disease outcomes.
      <br><br>
      Before my current position, I did my PhD in the [Berger Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/berger/en.html) at the [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) and [UW Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/). For my doctoral research, I studied how cancer hijacks our cells' systems for its own benefit, or in more technical terms, understanding oncogene-driven transcriptional regulation in lung cancer.
      <br> <br>
      Along with comp bio, I am also passionate about science communication and education, especially for underrepresented groups in the sciences.
