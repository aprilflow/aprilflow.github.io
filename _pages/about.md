      excerpt: "You can call me _April_, though I also respond to _pam_ or _pamyl_.<br><br>I am a PhD candidate in [Alice Berger's Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/berger/en.html) at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) and [University of Washington Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/). For my doctoral research, I study how cancer hijacks our cells' systems for its own benefit, or in more technical terms, my research is in understanding oncogene-driven transcriptional regulation in lung cancer.
      <br><br>Before graduate school, I got my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and Applied Mathematics and Statistics from the Johns Hopkins University where I also worked with the Karchin lab and got my first taste of computational cancer biology.
